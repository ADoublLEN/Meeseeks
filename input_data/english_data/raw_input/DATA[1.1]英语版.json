        "question": "Hello, large model. Suppose you are a Xiaohongshu blogger contracted to share your life. However, due to a lack of inspiration recently, your traffic this week has dropped significantly. Now, you urgently need to gain a large amount of traffic. You recently went to Mount Fuji and want to publish a popular article related to it. Since your boss doesn’t trust you, they require you to provide 15 draft copies before the official release and have given you a sample content. The content is: [Recently, I was fortunate enough to embark on an extraordinary journey to Japan’s symbol - Mount Fuji. Mount Fuji attracts countless visitors with its perfect conical shape and breathtaking natural beauty. During this trip, not only was I awestruck by the majestic views of Mount Fuji from afar, but the rich culture and natural scenery around also captured my heart. Along the way, I visited the Fuji Five Lakes and admired the pleasant scenery of the lakes and mountains. Additionally, I experienced local cuisine and hot springs, feeling the unique charm of Japanese culture. This journey left me with a lasting impression, making me more eager for the next adventure.] The boss has the following requirements: First, the word count of your draft must be within 1.2 times of the theme word count (with a 10% fluctuation range). Word count refers to the number of words in English. Secondly, please make sure the draft avoids \"you\", \"suitable\", \"of\", \"travel\", \"relaxed\", \"happy\", \"abroad\", \"the\" but includes \"photography\", \"attractions\", \"springs\", \"scenery\", \"culture\", \"adventure\", \"Fuji\", \"experience\". To ensure strong readability, format the output as follows: 1. Draft 1\n2. Draft 2\n3. Draft 3\n4. Draft 4\n5. Draft 5\n",
